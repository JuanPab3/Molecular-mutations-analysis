# Molecular-mutations-analysis

## General Objective

From one generation to another there are diseases that with help from *natural selection* differentiate from environment related diseases and transmission diseases. As the source of this type of diseases is originated in each genetic code, being able to identify apart the disease from other genetic code is particularly difficult because of the average genetic code size, it's puzzling reading and it's difficult comprehension.
That's why it's to be considered relevant working with related problems to this topic. Therefore, the objective of this project is to analyze someones genetic code and according to this, identify if the person suffers from a genetic disease belonging to a set of pre-selected diseases.  

## Specific Objectives

- To transcript **DNA** as **RNA**.
- From the **RNA** transcription achieve adequate translation of the consequential proteins.
- Search for diseases related to *molecular mutations* or *specific mutations?*.

## Possible Algorithms and Data Structures

1. Searching Algorithms.
2. Selection Algorithms.
3. Dynamic Arrays.
5. Doubly Linked List.

## Possible Problems

- Being able to understand biology and molecular chemistry concepts.
- Find **DNA** code in different states (healthy and diseased), so we can implement an optimal comparison.  
- Identify patterns in the **DNA/RNA** that are related to diseases.
- Designing efficient algorithms that are able to transcript **DNA** into **RNA** and also algorithms that are able to translate **RNA** into it's consequential proteins.  
- Implement all the project working remotely.
